## Description:

The retail business is fast-paced where the number and details of transactions cannot be recorded conveniently. Inventory is one of the most important departments of the retail industry and in order to ensure the business runs smoothly the inventory should be well managed. Inventory management also involves keeping details of customer transactions which would help manage any issues the customer has in the future with products. An inventory and sales management system helps record details of fast-moving products that have been supplied from manufacturers or sold to customers while also maintaining data about the manufacturers and customers.
